# Database Seeding Guide

This guide explains how to populate the database with sample data for the Acme Corp Patient Dashboard.

## Overview

The seeding system provides realistic patient data including:
- **Users**: Demo patients, admin, and moderator accounts
- **Weight Entries**: 13 initial entries + 25 recent entries (38 total)
- **Medications**: GLP-1 medication history
- **Shipments**: Medication delivery tracking

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Database Seeding

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Seed the database with initial data
npm run seed
```

### 2. Add Recent Weight Data (Optional)

```bash
# Add more recent weight entries (continues from last mock entry)
npm run add-recent-data
```

### Patient Account
- **Email**: `patient@example.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`
- **Role**: User

### Admin Account
- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `demo123`

## Scripts Available

### `npm run seed`
- Clears existing data
- Creates users, weight entries, medications, and shipments
- Provides initial dataset

### `npm run seed:dev`
- Same as `seed` but with development mode
- Includes hot reloading for development

### `npm run add-recent-data`
- Adds 25 additional weight entries
- Continues from the last mock entry (July 2024)
- Brings data up to June 2025
- Skips existing entries to avoid duplicates

## Data Structure

### Weight Entries
Each entry includes:
- Weight in pounds
- Date recorded
- Optional notes
- Timestamps

### User Data
Each user includes:
- Personal information
- Contact details
- Role-based permissions
- Encrypted password

### Medication Data
- Medication name and dosage
- Frequency and duration
- Start/end dates

### Shipment Data
- Order and delivery tracking
- Status updates
- Shipping information

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
Ensure your MongoDB instance is running and the connection string in `.env` is correct.

### Duplicate Entries
The `add-recent-data` script automatically checks for existing entries and skips duplicates.

### Permission Issues
Make sure you have write permissions to the database.

## Development Notes

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Dates are stored in ISO format
- User IDs are MongoDB ObjectIds
- Weight entries are linked to users via userId

## Next Steps

After seeding:
1. Start the backend server: `npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd ../frontend && npm run dev`
3. Log in with demo credentials
4. Explore the weight tracking dashboard
5. Test CRUD operations for weight entries

The seeded data provides a realistic foundation for testing all dashboard features and demonstrating the weight loss journey visualization.
